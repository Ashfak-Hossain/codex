**GCD** (Greatest Common Divisor) is also known as  **HCF** (Highest Common Factor) or **GCF** (Greatest Common Factor).  What is GCD ? GCD of two or more integers $(i \ne 0)$ is the largest int which divides both integers without leaving a reminder.
For integers $a$ and $b$ , $gcd(a, b)$ denotes the largest positive integers $d$  such that $d \mid a$  and $d \mid b$ where $a \mid b$ means $a$ divides $b$.

Example of **GCD** :
$$
\begin{array}{cc}
12 & \{1, 2, 3, {\color{red} 4}, 6, 12\} \\
8 & \{1,2,{\color{red} 4},8\} \\
\hline
\gcd(12,8) & \max(12 \cap 8) = \color{red}{4}
\end{array}
$$
