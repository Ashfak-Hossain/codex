**Ashfak Hossain** — CS undergraduate at [AIUB](https://www.aiub.edu/). I trace proofs, algorithms, and the useless notes that ==almost== looks like understanding.

This blog is my relaxed workspace on the internet — a messy parking lot for my notes, weird imagination, and half‑formed ideas that are still booting. Consider maths that sometimes behaves and those quiet _“wait, does this even make sense?”_ moments, archived for a future version of me who hopefully has it slightly more figured out.
